equations of systems can be
1. complete - non singular - unique solution - det != 0
2. redundant - singular - infinite solutions - det == 0
3. contradictory - singular - no solutions - det == 0

constants dont matter for singularity

* singular and singular matrices

3 planes
1. unique sol - single point
2. no solution - all planes are parallel
3. infinite solutions - common plane
