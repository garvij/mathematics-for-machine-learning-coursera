row operations/transformations
1. row swapping
2. scalar multiplication
3. row addition

rank of matrix = info held by the matrix/system of equations
rank of matrix = number of pivots

calculation of rank
A is square matrix
1. minor method
 1. if det(A) != 0 rank = order of A
 2. if det(A) == 0 rank = order of max possible non zero minor
2. using echelon form

echelon form
1. all elements under pivot are 0

reduced row echelon form
1. each pivot is 1

steps for converting to echelon form
1. reduce element below first pivot to 0
2. continue for all pivots
